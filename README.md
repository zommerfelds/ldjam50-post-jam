Some notes for what a did at each day.

## After day 1

Can't really play much, but you can move cards around and they tween nicely. Can build tracks by dragging from an existing track and then placing track cards.

## After day 2

Added a playable version of the cards. Added sounds and graphics. Added lakes. Well I ran out of time to implement anything. See https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/debt-train-card-construction-game for the final submission.
